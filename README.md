# ATM Simulation in Python

This project aims to simulate the behaviour of an ATM using Python. The program allows users to check their account balance, deposit money and withdraw money in a simple interface.

## Introduction

An ATM (Automated Teller Machine) is a widely used electronic device that allows bank customers to perform various financial transactions without the need for human assistance. This Python program provides a basic simulation of an ATM system, allowing users to interact with their accounts to check balances, deposit money and withdraw money.

## Features

The ATM simulation program provides the following features:

- Check account balance: Users can check their account balance to see how much money they have in their account.
- Deposit funds: Users can deposit money into their account using this feature.
- Withdraw funds: Users can withdraw money from their account if they have sufficient funds.

## Usage

To run the ATM simulation program, follow the steps below:

- Install Python on your computer if it's not already installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Clone the repo on your local machine
- Setup a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv myenv`
- Activate the virtual environment: `source myenv/bin/activate`
- Optional: Change the PIN in the atm object in **main.py**
- Optional: Change the balance in the atm object in **main.py**
- Run the code: `python main.py`
- Start using the ATM by following the steps

I have completed this ATM simulation project during a course at TechTalent Academy.
